# What is malware?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- A portmanteau of "malicious software"
- Programs that are intentionally malicious
- Distinct from software that is defective
- Real-world examples of malware:
    - Viruses
    - Worms
    - Trojans
    - Ransomware
    - Spyware

:::

# *Probing Questions*: have you every encountered malware? What happened? How did you resolve it? Lessons?

# Malware Targets

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Malware targets:
  - Windows operating systems
  - Web browsers
  - Android devices
- Malware considers:
  - How many users are affected?
  - How easily can it infect and spread?
  - How much money can it generate?

:::

# Zero-Day Exploits

::: incremental

- Malware typically needs elevated privileges to run
- *Goal*: privilege escalation without user interaction
- What is a zero-day exploit?
    - A previously unknown vulnerability
    - No patch or fix available
    - Attackers exploit the vulnerability
    - Supports malware delivery and attack

# Understanding Worms

::: fragment

- Self-replicating and self-propagating software

- Worms can spread without user interaction

- **Primary goal**: infect as many devices as possible

- Worms can be spread via:
  - Email
  - Network shares
  - USB drives

:::

# Understanding Viruses

::: fragment

- Modifies a program and inserts their own code

- Viruses often require user interaction to spread

- **Primary goal**: cause damage or steal information

- Viruses can be spread via:
  - Email
  - Downloads
  - Web sites

:::

# Understanding Trojans

::: fragment

- Disguises itself as a normal file or program

- Trojan horses often require user interaction to spread

- **Primary goal**: create a backdoor in your system for malicious activities

- Trojan horses can be spread via:
  - Email
  - Downloads
  - Web sites

:::

# Exploring Ransomware

::: fragment

- Access and then encrypts a victim's files

- Demands access to payment to decrypt the files

- **Primary goal**: extort money by denying file access

- Ransomware can be spread via:
  - Phishing emails
  - Malicious downloads
  - Exploiting network security holes

:::

# Understanding Spyware

::: fragment

- Secretly monitors and collects user activity

- Often installed without the user's knowledge

- **Primary goal**: gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge

- Spyware can be spread via:
  - Phishing emails
  - Malicious downloads
  - Bundled with other software

# Insights About Malware

::: incremental

- Easy exploits once you have gained access!
  - Recursive traversal of directories
  - Search for sensitive and/or system files
  - Encrypt files, delete originals, demand ransom
- Which programming language should be used for malware?
- Trade-offs for implementing and deploying malware?

:::

# Installation with `curl` and `bash`! We do this?!?

::: incremental

- Examples of common installation methods:
    - `curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash`
    - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/install.sh)"`
- What are the security risks of these commands?
- What are the alternatives to these installation methods?
