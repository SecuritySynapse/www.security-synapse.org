- Real-world examples of malware:
    - Viruses
    - Worms
    - Trojans
    - Ransomware
    - Spyware

# *Probing Questions*: have you every encountered malware? What happened? How did you resolve it? Lessons?

# Malware Targets

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Malware targets:
  - Windows operating systems
  - Web browsers
  - Android devices
- Malware considers:
  - How many users are affected?
  - How easily can it infect and spread?
  - How much money can it generate?

# Zero-Day Exploits

::: incremental

- Malware typically needs elevated privileges to run
- *Goal*: privilege escalation without user interaction
- What is a zero-day exploit?
    - A previously unknown vulnerability
    - No patch or fix available
    - Attackers exploit the vulnerability
    - Supports malware delivery and attack
