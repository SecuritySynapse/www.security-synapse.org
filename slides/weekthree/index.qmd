### *Think Like Hacker*

#### Implementation

- Look for vulnerabilities
- Try to exploit them
- Identify weakest links

#### Prevention

- Use secure coding practices
- Leverage security tools
- Rethink everything!

# What is cryptography?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Establish secure and confidential communication channels
- Supports creation of digital signatures
- Allows us to support the "AAA principles":
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Accounting
- Ensures that attackers cannot "listen in" to communication
- Ensures *non-repudiation* of digital communication

:::

# *Important Insight*: cryptography is one of the key building blocks of computer security!

# *Key Reminder*: it is deceptively difficult to deploy cryptographic algorithms correctly!

# *Admonition*: avoid the temptation to "roll your own" cryptography algorithms!

# When do you use cryptography?

::: fragment

- Commit data to a GitHub repository
- Access a website using HTTPS
- Use a password manager
- Send a message in chat app

# Cryptography Terminology

::: fragment

- **Plaintext**: the original message
- **Ciphertext**: the encrypted message
- **Cipher**: the algorithm used to encrypt the message
- **Key**: the secret used to encrypt the message
    - **Symmetric Key**: the same key  to encrypt and decrypt
    - **Asymmetric Key**: different keys to encrypt and decrypt

:::

## Trapdoor Functions

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- **One-way function**: easy to compute, hard to invert
- **Examples**: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Digital Signatures
- Insights about the RSA algorithm:
    - Easy to multiply two large prime numbers
      - Exponentiation
      - Multiplication
      - Modular arithmetic
    - Hard to factor the product of two large prime numbers
    - Encryption is "easy" and decryption is "hard"
:::

## Cryptographic Hash Functions

- **Input**: any length of data
- **Output**: fixed length of data
- **Example**: SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5
- Insights about the SHA-256 algorithm:
    - Fixed length output
    - Deterministic
    - Fast computation
    - Designed by NSA

## Symmetric Encryption

- **Single key** used for encryption and decryption
- **Examples**: AES, DES, 3DES
- Insights about the AES algorithm:
    - Block-based cipher
    - Key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits
    - Performs multiple rounds of encryption
    - Designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen
- *Wait*, how do you exchange the key securely?

## Asymmetric Encryption

- **Public key** used for encryption
- **Private key** used for decryption
- Steps for receiving an encrypted message:
    - Generate a public/private key pair
    - Share the public key to a key server
    - Friend encrypts message with public key
    - You decrypt the message with the private key
- **Important trade-off**: slower than symmetric encryption!

## Steam and Block Ciphers

- **Stream Cipher**: encrypts one byte at a time
- **Block Cipher**: encrypts a block of bytes
- **Example**: AES is a block cipher!
- Modes of operation for block ciphers:
    - ECB: Electronic Codebook
    - CBC: Cipher Block Chaining
    - CFB: Cipher Feedback
    - OFB: Output Feedback
    - CTR: Counter

## Combining Cryptography Algorithms

- A virtual private network (VPN) works like this:
    - Use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric key
    - Use symmetric encryption for data transmission
- **Important Insights**
    - Fast because it mostly uses symmetric encryption
    - Using multiple algorithms can maintain/increase security
    - Yet, only as secure as the weakest link!

- Whenever possible, limit manual human intervention in a secure
process to avoid unexpected mistakes!

## Case Study: Let's Encrypt

::: fragment

- **Goal**: Always encrypt packets sent to a web site!
- **Problem**: How to make HTTPS more accessible?
- **Solution**: Automated certificate authority system

:::

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.75em;"}

- Insights about the Let's Encrypt system:
    - Uses the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol
    - Provides free SSL/TLS certificates
    - Automates the certificate renewal process
    - Requires a web server to support HTTPS

:::

## *Cool*, Let's Encrypt is open source and free and supported by Netlify!

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- How do you get a certificate for your web site:
    - Customer generates a certificate signing request (CSR)
    - Customer sends CSR to Let's Encrypt
    - Let's Encrypt verifies the CSR
    - Let's Encrypt issues a certificate
    - Customer installs the certificate on their web server
    - Direct integration with systems like Netlify
