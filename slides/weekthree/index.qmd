# What is cryptography?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Establish secure and confidential communication channels
- Supports creation of digital signatures
- Allows us to support the "AAA principles":
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Accounting
- Ensures that attackers cannot "listen in" to communication
- Ensures *non-repudiation* of digital communication

:::

# *Important Insight*: cryptography is one of the key building blocks of computer security!

# *Key Reminder*: it is deceptively difficult to deploy cryptographic algorithms correctly!

# *Admonition*: avoid the temptation to "roll your own" cryptography algorithms!

# When do you use cryptography?

::: fragment

- Commit data to a GitHub repository
- Access a website using HTTPS
- Use a password manager
- Send a message in chat app

## Overall goals of "security synapse"

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- **High-Level Concepts**
  - Concepts such as *confidentiality* and *integrity*
  - Test all aspects of the system to ensure correctness
  - Make a benchmark framework to measure performance
- **Low-Level Implementation Details**
  - Use cryptography to secure transferred data
  - Use hashing to verify data integrity
  - Secure implementation in programming languages

:::

# *Implementation*: which languages are reputed to be the most or least secure? Why? Do you agree with consensus?

# Let's Make a Computer Security Synapse

- Obfuscate a file using a symmetric key
- Compute the Sha256 hash of a file
- Illustrate an insecure memory access
- Use a synthetic JSON file to illustrate concepts
- Make sure to `pip install cryptography`!

### *Think Like Hacker*

#### Implementation

- Look for vulnerabilities
- Try to exploit them
- Identify weakest links

#### Prevention

- Use secure coding practices
- Leverage security tools
- Rethink everything!
