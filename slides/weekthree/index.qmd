# What is cryptography?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Establish secure and confidential communication channels
- Supports creation of digital signatures
- Allows us to support the "AAA principles":
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Accounting
- Ensures that attackers cannot "listen in" to communication
- Ensures *non-repudiation* of digital communication

:::

# *Important Insight*: cryptography is one of the key building blocks of computer security!

# *Key Reminder*: it is deceptively difficult to deploy cryptographic algorithms correctly!

# *Admonition*: avoid the temptation to "roll your own" cryptography algorithms!

# When do you use cryptography?

::: fragment

- Commit data to a GitHub repository
- Access a website using HTTPS
- Use a password manager
- Send a message in chat app

# Cryptography Terminology

::: fragment

- **Plaintext**: the original message
- **Ciphertext**: the encrypted message
- **Cipher**: the algorithm used to encrypt the message
- **Key**: the secret used to encrypt the message
    - **Symmetric Key**: the same key  to encrypt and decrypt
    - **Asymmetric Key**: different keys to encrypt and decrypt
