# What is infosec?

::: incremental

- Prevent unauthorized access to data on a computer system
- Data is both sensitive and valuable and must be protected
- Risk management is the focus of information security
- Malware often helps an attacker gain access to a system
- System failure often occurs during an attack with malware

**Key Questions**: Have you ever been the subject of an information security
attack? What was the attack vector? Could it have been prevented? What
strategies would have enabled your defense?

## Algorithm analysis process

::: incremental
- Design, implement, and test
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Benchmark framework
  - Data analysis tools
- Create execution environments
  - Repeatable and reproducible
  - Controlled and varied
  - Local and in the cloud
:::

## Examples of four programs to study through performance benchmarks

- Terminal window shell like `bash` or `zsh`
- Terminal prompt like `powerlevel10k` or `starship`
- Web browser like `firefox` or `chrome`
- Text editor like `vim` or `emacs`

*...* How do we *characterize* the execution environment of these programs? *...* How
do we *compare* their performance in different configurations? *...* How do we
*improve* their performance? *...*

## Overall goals of "algorithmology"

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- **Algorithm Engineering**:
  - Design and implement algorithm and data structure
  - Test all aspects of the system to ensure correctness
  - Make a benchmark framework to measure performance
- **Algorithm Evaluation**:
  - Design experiments to answer research questions
  - Conduct experiments and collect data
  - Analyze and visualize data to draw conclusions
