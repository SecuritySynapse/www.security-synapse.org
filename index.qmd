## Welcome to an Adventure in Computer Security!

With the goal of enabling the growth of computer security engineers, this web
site features a sixteen-week schedule filled with activities that support the
development of your professional and technical capacities in the field of
computer security. One of the primary goals of this course is to create a
*security synapse* by connecting high-level concepts in the field of computer
security with their implementation in programming languages such as Python,
Java, JavaScript, C, Go, and Rust. Along with leveraging research papers and
popular-press articles, this course references two open-access books: [Computer
Systems Security: Planning for Success](https://web.njit.edu/~rt494/security/)
and [Cracking Codes with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/). You
can access all of the source code and technical content for this course by
checking out its [GitHub organization](https://github.com/SecuritySynapse),
[schedule](schedule/index.qmd), and [slides](slides/index.qmd).

## Resources for Making a Security Synapse

Interested in getting started on a computer security adventure? Begin here:

- The [sixteen-week course schedule](./schedule/index.qmd) offers detailed
insights into each step that learners should take to help them to effectively
make security synapses, including a list of reading assignments and descriptions
of the class activities and projects.

- The [course syllabus](./syllabus/index.qmd) introduces the course and its
learning objectives, overviews the security survey and security summit projects,
and explains how on-campus learners will be assessed by the instructor
through examinations and in-person evaluations.
