## Welcome to an Adventure in Computer Security!

In addition to ensuring that the programs they implement are correct and
maintainable, algorithm engineers must confirm that their code is efficient.
The focus of this course --- called "algorithmology" for fun! --- is the study
of algorithms, with a concentration on both their correctness and efficiency.
The process of algorithmology requires the completion of tasks that leverage
knowledge and skills in both engineering and science. For instance, an
algorithm engineer needs to design, implement, and test data structures and
algorithms and then correctly integrate them into a working software system.
However, an algorithm engineer must also employ the scientific method to
analyze the efficiency of both a software system's components and the system as
a whole. This course introduces learners to both empirical and analytical
approaches to studying the efficiency of algorithms, data structures, and the
software systems that contain them.

## Course Overview

With the goal of enabling the growth of algorithm engineers, this web site
features a sixteen-week schedule filled with activities that support the
development of your professional and technical capacities in the field of
algorithm analysis. Although this site is best used by an on-campus learner in
the [Department of Computer and information
Science](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/) at [Allegheny
College](https://www.allegheny.edu/), the resources and projects are all
publicly available. For instance, this course leverages and extends the
open-access course textbook called [A First Course on Data Structures in
Python](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures). You can access all of the
source code and technical content for this book by checking out its GitHub
repository and following along with the [schedule](schedule/index.qmd) and the
[slides](slides/index.qmd) for this course, as found on this site.

## Resources for an Adventure in Algorithmology

- The [sixteen-week course schedule](./schedule/index.qmd) offers detailed
insights into each step that learners should take to help them to emerge as
algorithm engineers, including a list of reading assignments and descriptions
of various algorithm engineering projects.

- The [course syllabus](./syllabus/index.qmd) introduces the course and its
learning objectives and explains how on-campus learners will be assessed by the
course instructor.

the [Algorithmology Discord Server](https://discord.gg/phSQfB8bZx) and join the
conversation! If you are an on-campus learning at Allegheny College, you may
also join the [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6). Finally, if you are an on-campus
learner, then you may schedule a meeting with the course instructor during
office hours by visiting the [Course Instructor's Appointment
Scheduler](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).
